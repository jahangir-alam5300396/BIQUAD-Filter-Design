# 05 â€“ Circuit Design

Moving from simulation to real-world hardware requires careful component selection and layout.

### Practical Design Tips

- Use low tolerance resistors and capacitors
- Watch for PCB parasitics: trace inductance, stray capacitance
- Place decoupling capacitors close to op-amps
- Test first on a breadboard or ASLK Pro board

### LTspice Circuit Schematic

The following diagram shows the BIQUAD universal filter circuit simulated in LTspice using op-amps, resistors, and capacitors.
