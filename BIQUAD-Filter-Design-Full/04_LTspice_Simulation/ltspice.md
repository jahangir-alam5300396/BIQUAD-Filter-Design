# 04 â€“ LTspice Simulation

This section presents simulations done in LTspice for various BIQUAD filter topologies.

### Simulated Responses

- Frequency response for LPF, HPF, BPF, BSF
- Step response with Q=1 and Q=10

### Band-Pass Filter Frequency Response

This is the LTspice simulation output showing frequency responses of multiple filter types (Band-pass, Low-pass, High-pass, and Band-stop):
