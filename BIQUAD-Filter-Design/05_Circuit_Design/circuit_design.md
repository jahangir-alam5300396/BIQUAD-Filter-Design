# 05 â€“ Circuit Design

This section explains practical aspects of translating simulations to real circuits:

- Tolerance consideration for resistors/capacitors
- Minimizing parasitics in layout
- Example circuits using Sallen-Key, Tow-Thomas, and KHN topologies

Hardware is prototyped using ASLK Pro board before PCB realization.
