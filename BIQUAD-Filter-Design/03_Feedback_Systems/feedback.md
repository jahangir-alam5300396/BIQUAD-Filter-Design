# 03 â€“ Feedback Systems

Feedback is essential in Op-Amp circuits:

- Reduces gain sensitivity to component variations
- Prevents output saturation
- Helps control input/output impedance
- Extends bandwidth

Different feedback configurations are used for voltage, current, and transconductance amplification.
