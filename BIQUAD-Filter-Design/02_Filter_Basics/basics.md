# 02 â€“ Basics of Filter Design

To design an efficient filter, several parameters must be defined:

- Cutoff frequency
- Passband gain
- Stopband attenuation
- Ripple tolerance
- Quality factor (Q)

The section also covers the effect of poles and zeros, and compares different approximation types like Butterworth, Chebyshev, Elliptic, and Bessel.
