# 01 – Introduction

In this project, I explore the design and implementation of a BIQUAD filter — a second-order active filter widely used in analog signal processing.

## Motivation

Filtering is essential for:
- Extracting desired signals from noisy environments
- Attenuating unwanted frequency components
- Improving overall signal quality in both analog and digital systems

### Why Active Filters?

Active filters (using Op-Amps) offer key advantages:
- Signal amplification capability
- Isolation between load and filter stage
- High input impedance and low output impedance

These properties make them suitable for audio processing, communication systems, and measurement instrumentation.
