# 01 â€“ Introduction

This section explains the motivation behind designing filters in analog systems. Signal processing often requires filtering to:

- Extract desired signals
- Suppress noise
- Separate overlapping frequency components

Active filters using Op-Amps offer advantages like amplification, impedance matching, and buffering, making them suitable for modern electronics.
